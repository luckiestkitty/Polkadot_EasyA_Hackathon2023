## Polkadot Educational Slack Bot

The Polkadot EduBot is a Python-based Slack bot that uses the OpenAI Chat API to facilitate interactive learning about the Polkadot network. It manages a knowledge base of Polkadot documents (URLs, PDFs) uploaded to a dedicated vectorstore. This allows the bot to provide detailed responses to user queries, promoting a dynamic and engaging educational experience.
